# my-slackbot
creating a slackbot that combines multiple useful one (simple poll and donut as of now)

you can:
1. set the size of coffee chats via /donut set size _n_
2. set the channel that donut will use to sample users from
3. send out coffee chats either manually or as often as you set

in progress:
1. simple poll functionality
2. serverless hosting on vercel
3. gpt integration for funny icebreakers
