# donut-rep
this is a more involved copy of slack donut bot

you can:\
A. set the size of coffee chats via /donut set size _n_\
B. set the channel that donut will use to sample users from\

eventually, I want to add vercel hosting and potentially integration with GPT so it starts coffee chats with icebreakers or ideas for meetings
